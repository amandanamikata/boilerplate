## What is CloudShop?

CloudShop is an **online store** (like Amazon or eBay, but much simpler).

**What it does:**
- Shows a list of products
- Lets users create an account
- Lets users add products to a shopping cart
- Lets users place orders
- Shows order history

**What makes it special:**
It's built using **modern technologies** that big companies use, which makes it:
- Fast
- Reliable
- Easy to update
- Can handle many users at once

---

## Understanding the Big Picture

### 🏢 The Restaurant Analogy

Think of CloudShop like a restaurant:

1. **Frontend (The Dining Area)**
   - This is what customers see and interact with
   - The menu, tables, decorations
   - In our project: The website you see in your browser

2. **API Gateway (The Waiter)**
   - Takes orders from customers
   - Brings requests to the kitchen
   - Brings food back to customers
   - In our project: Routes your requests to the right place

3. **Microservices (Different Kitchen Stations)**
   - **Product Service** = Ingredient storage (knows about all products)
   - **User Service** = Customer records (knows about all users)
   - **Order Service** = Order preparation (handles orders)
   - Each station does ONE job really well

4. **Database (The Refrigerator/Storage)**
   - Stores all the data
   - In our project: MongoDB stores products, users, and orders

5. **Kubernetes (The Restaurant Manager)**
   - Makes sure everything runs smoothly
   - If something breaks, fixes it automatically
   - Adds more workers when busy

6. **Docker (Standard Recipe Cards)**
   - Makes sure the food is made the same way every time
   - In our project: Packages each service so it runs the same everywhere

7. **CI/CD (Automated Delivery Truck)**
   - Automatically delivers new ingredients when you order them
   - In our project: Automatically updates your app when you make changes

## What Each Technology Does

### 🌐 Frontend Technologies

#### Vue.js
**What it is:** A JavaScript framework for building websites

**Simple explanation:**
Think of it like **LEGO blocks for websites**. Instead of writing everything from scratch, Vue gives you pre-made blocks (components) you can snap together to build a website quickly.

**In CloudShop:**
- Displays the product catalog
- Shows the shopping cart
- Handles buttons and forms

#### HTML/CSS
**What it is:** The building blocks of websites

**Simple explanation:**
- **HTML** = The skeleton (structure)
  - Like: "Put a picture here, put text there, add a button"
- **CSS** = The skin and clothes (styling)
  - Like: "Make this button blue, make text big, add rounded corners"

### 🔧 Backend Technologies

#### Node.js
**What it is:** JavaScript for servers

**Simple explanation:**
Normally, JavaScript only runs in web browsers. Node.js lets JavaScript run on servers (computers that host websites). It's like taking a car engine and putting it in a boat - same power, different use.

#### Express
**What it is:** A framework for building web servers

**Simple explanation:**
If Node.js is the engine, Express is the steering wheel and pedals. It makes it easy to:
- Listen for requests (like someone knocking on your door)
- Send responses back (like answering the door)
- Handle different types of requests (like having different doors for deliveries vs guests)

#### MongoDB
**What it is:** A database (storage for data)

**Simple explanation:**
Like a **digital filing cabinet**. Instead of paper files, it stores data about:
- Products (name, price, stock)
- Users (email, password, name)
- Orders (what was bought, when, by whom)

**Why MongoDB specifically:**
- Stores data in a flexible format (like JSON)
- Fast for reading and writing
- Good for applications that need to grow

### 📦 DevOps Technologies

#### Docker
**What it is:** Containerization technology

**Simple explanation:**
Imagine you're moving houses. Docker is like those **portable storage containers**:
- Pack everything inside (your app + all its needs)
- Container works the same way anywhere (your computer, a server, the cloud)
- Nothing gets lost or broken during the move

**Example:**
Your app needs:
- Node.js version 18
- Specific libraries
- Configuration files

Docker packages ALL of this together, so it runs the same way on:
- Your laptop
- Your friend's laptop
- A server in the cloud

#### Kubernetes (K8s)
**What it is:** Container orchestration

**Simple explanation:**
If Docker is the **shipping container**, Kubernetes is the **entire shipping port**:
- Decides where containers go
- Monitors if containers are working
- Restarts containers if they crash
- Adds more containers when busy
- Removes containers when not needed

**Real-world example:**
Your website gets popular suddenly:
- Without Kubernetes: Website crashes, you manually add servers
- With Kubernetes: Automatically adds more servers, handles traffic

#### GitHub Actions (CI/CD)
**What it is:** Automation for software updates

**Simple explanation:**
Like a **robot assistant** that does boring, repetitive tasks:

**Without CI/CD (Manual):**
1. You make a code change
2. You test it manually
3. You build the application
4. You upload to server
5. You restart the server
(Takes 30 minutes, easy to make mistakes)

**With CI/CD (Automatic):**
1. You make a code change
2. Push to GitHub
3. Robot does everything else automatically
(Takes 5 minutes, no mistakes)

## How to Run This Project

### Option 1: Run on Your Computer (Easiest)

#### Step 1: Install Required Software

**What you need:**
1. **Node.js** - JavaScript runtime
   - Download: https://nodejs.org
   - Install the LTS (Long Term Support) version
   - Check it worked: Open terminal/command prompt, type `node --version`

2. **Git** - Version control
   - Download: https://git-scm.com
   - Check it worked: Type `git --version`

3. **Code Editor** - To view/edit code
   - Recommended: VS Code (https://code.visualstudio.com)

#### Step 2: Get the Code

Open terminal/command prompt and type:

```bash
# Go to where you want to store the project
cd Desktop

# Download the project
git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/cloudshop.git

# Go into the project folder
cd cloudshop
```

#### Step 3: Start the Backend Services

**Start each service in a separate terminal window:**

```bash
# Terminal 1 - Product Service
cd product-service
npm install          # Download dependencies (first time only)
npm run dev         # Start the service
# You'll see: "Product service listening on port 3001"
```

```bash
# Terminal 2 - User Service
cd user-service
npm install
npm run dev
# You'll see: "User service listening on port 3002"
```

```bash
# Terminal 3 - Order Service
cd order-service
npm install
npm run dev
# You'll see: "Order service listening on port 3003"
```

```bash
# Terminal 4 - API Gateway
cd api-gateway
npm install
npm run dev
# You'll see: "API Gateway listening on port 3000"
```

**What's happening:**
- Each service is like a separate program
- They're all running at the same time
- They can talk to each other

#### Step 4: Start MongoDB Database

**You need MongoDB running for the services to store data.**

**Option A: Install MongoDB locally**
- Download: https://www.mongodb.com/try/download/community
- Install and run

**Option B: Use Docker (easier)**
```bash
docker run -d -p 27017:27017 --name mongodb mongo:7.0
```

#### Step 5: Start the Frontend

```bash
# Terminal 5 - Frontend
cd frontend
npm install
npm run dev
# You'll see: "Local: http://localhost:8080"
```

#### Step 6: Visit the Website

Open your web browser and go to:
```
http://localhost:8080
```

**You should see:**
- The CloudShop homepage
- A list of products (might be empty at first)
- A navigation bar with Cart, Login

---

### Option 2: Run with Docker (More Advanced)

Docker runs everything in containers, so you don't need to install Node.js, MongoDB, etc.

```bash
# Build all containers
docker-compose up --build

# Visit http://localhost:8080
```

**Note:** You need to have Docker installed first:
- Download: https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop

```

### What's in package.json?

Think of it like a **shopping list** for code:

```json
{
  "dependencies": {
    "express": "^4.18.2",    ← Need Express framework
    "mongoose": "^7.5.0"     ← Need MongoDB connection
  }
}
```

When you run `npm install`, it:
1. Reads the shopping list
2. Downloads everything from the internet
3. Puts it in `node_modules` folder

## How Everything Works Together

### Example: Buying a Product

Let's trace what happens when you click "Add to Cart":

#### Step 1: User Clicks Button
- **Location:** Frontend (your browser)
- **File:** `frontend/src/components/ProductCard.vue`
- **Code:** `@click="addToCart"`

#### Step 2: Frontend Updates Cart
- **Location:** Frontend state management
- **File:** `frontend/src/store/cart.js`
- **What happens:**
  - Product added to cart array
  - Cart saved to browser localStorage
  - Cart badge updates (shows number of items)

#### Step 3: User Goes to Checkout
- **Location:** Frontend
- **File:** `frontend/src/views/Checkout.vue`
- **What happens:**
  - Shows shipping form
  - Lists cart items
  - Calculates total

#### Step 4: User Clicks "Place Order"
- **Location:** Frontend makes API call
- **File:** `frontend/src/services/api.js`
- **Code:** `orderAPI.create(orderData)`
- **Request sent to:** `http://localhost:3000/api/orders`

#### Step 5: API Gateway Receives Request
- **Location:** API Gateway
- **File:** `api-gateway/src/index.js`
- **What happens:**
  - Receives POST request to `/api/orders`
  - Forwards to Order Service

#### Step 6: Order Service Processes
- **Location:** Order Service
- **File:** `order-service/src/routes/orders.js`
- **What happens:**
  1. Receives order data
  2. **Calls Product Service** to verify products exist
  3. Gets current prices from Product Service
  4. Creates order in database
  5. Returns order confirmation

#### Step 7: Response Returns to User
- **Path:** Order Service → API Gateway → Frontend
- **What user sees:** "Order placed successfully!"
- **What happens:** Redirected to Order History page

### Visual Flow

```
USER BROWSER
    ↓
[Frontend (Vue.js)]
    ↓ HTTP Request
[API Gateway]
    ↓ Routes to correct service
┌────────────┬────────────┬────────────┐
│  Product   │   User     │   Order    │
│  Service   │  Service   │  Service   │
└────┬───────┴─────┬──────┴─────┬──────┘
     ↓             ↓            ↓
[MongoDB]    [MongoDB]     [MongoDB]
(products)    (users)      (orders)
```

## Common Problems and Solutions

### Problem 1: "Port already in use"

**Error message:**
```
Error: listen EADDRINUSE: address already in use :::3000
```

**What it means:**
Something is already using port 3000 (like another program or old instance of your app)

**Solution:**
```bash
# On Mac/Linux:
lsof -ti:3000 | xargs kill

# On Windows:
netstat -ano | findstr :3000
# Then: taskkill /PID <number> /F
```

**Simple explanation:**
Ports are like doors. Only one program can use each door at a time. This command closes the door so your app can use it.

### Problem 2: "npm: command not found"

**What it means:**
Node.js is not installed or not in your PATH

**Solution:**
1. Download Node.js from https://nodejs.org
2. Install it
3. Restart your terminal
4. Try again

### Problem 3: "Cannot connect to MongoDB"

**Error message:**
```
MongoDB connection error: connect ECONNREFUSED 127.0.0.1:27017
```

**What it means:**
MongoDB is not running

**Solution:**
```bash
# Start MongoDB with Docker (easiest):
docker run -d -p 27017:27017 --name mongodb mongo:7.0

# Or install MongoDB locally and start it
```

### Problem 4: "Module not found"

**Error message:**
```
Error: Cannot find module 'express'
```

**What it means:**
Dependencies not installed

**Solution:**
```bash
# Install dependencies:
npm install
```

### Problem 5: Frontend shows blank page

**Possible causes:**
1. Backend services not running
2. Wrong API URL
3. CORS error

**Solution:**
1. Make sure all backend services are running
2. Check browser console for errors (F12 → Console tab)
3. Make sure API Gateway is running on port 3000
